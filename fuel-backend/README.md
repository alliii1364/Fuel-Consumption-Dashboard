## Key Notes

- Passwords: supports both plain-text and MD5-hashed passwords from `gs_users`
- Formula evaluation: uses `expr-eval` (no `eval()`)
- Calibration: linear interpolation with clamp on out-of-range values
- Consumption: drops < 0.5L ignored (noise), gains > 3L treated as refuel
- All timestamps in UTC; optional `?tz=Asia/Karachi` for output conversion
- IMEI ownership enforced on every vehicle route — no cross-user data access
